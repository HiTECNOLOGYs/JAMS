Just Another Minecraft Server
==============================

Written in 100% pure CL.

The very basic idea behind this server was that I wasn't satisfied with
CraftBukkit and others. It was also inspired by Bravo server which is another
Minecraft server but written in Python and reverse-engineered by author
himself. I instead stick to information provided by wiki.vg which is an
excellent resource on Minecraft protocol and stuff.

Dependencies
-------------

* **flexi-streams** - easy requests/responds deconding/encoding.
* **iolib** - networking
* **ieee-floats** - floats/double decoding/encoding
* **lparallel** - queues/threading
* **bordeaux-threads** - threading
* **salza2** - data compression
* **cl-store** - serialization
* **alexandria** - lots of handy stuff
* **iterate** - loops and stuff
* **closer-mop** - MOP
* **log4cl** - logging

What exactly can it do?
------------------------

Nothing, but I can do something. For example, I can draw a little cube:

    --------
    |      |
    | Weee |
    |      |
    --------

It's definitely a cube, you're just looking at it at wrong angle.

What is the plan?
------------------

Build full-featured Minecraft server software that I'm satisfied with.

When will it be done?
----------------------

I'm doing my best.
